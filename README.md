Q3:-> WAP to input principal, rate, time & find the simple interest.

Simple interest is a straightforward method of calculating interest on a principal amount over a fixed period of time. Unlike compound interest, which calculates interest on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest, simple interest is calculated only on the initial principal.

The formula to calculate simple interest is:
1. Simple Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
2. Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time)/100

Where:

Principal: The initial amount of money (the amount borrowed or invested).
Rate: The annual interest rate (expressed as a decimal).
Time: The time duration for which the money is borrowed or invested (in years).

Here's a breakdown of each component:

Principal (P): The initial amount of money involved in the transaction.
Rate (R): The annual interest rate, usually expressed as a percentage. For example, if the annual interest rate is 5%, then the rate would be 0.05.
Time (T): The time duration for which the money is borrowed or invested, typically expressed in years.


Let's say you borrow $1,000 at a simple annual interest rate of 5% for 3 years. To calculate the simple interest:

Principal (P) = $1,000
Rate (R) = 0.05
Time (T) = 3 years

Simple Interest = $1,000 × 0.05 × 3 = $150

So, the simple interest on a $1,000 loan at 5% interest for 3 years would be $150.

It's important to note that with simple interest, the interest amount remains constant each year, as it's calculated only on the original principal amount. This makes simple interest easier to calculate compared to compound interest. However, it may not accurately reflect the true cost of borrowing or the potential returns on investments over time.
